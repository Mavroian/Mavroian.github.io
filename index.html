            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p>    I was born in Bucharest, Romania in 1986. The name “Romania” comes from the Latin word “Romanus” which means “citizen of the Roman Empire, and that is because our country, like many others, was conquered by Romans, and after defeating us they decided to stay. click here if you want to know<a href="https://worldstrides.com/blog/2017/10/14-interesting-facts-romania/"> more interesting fact about Romania.</a> 
            </p>
            <p>    At about the age of four, right after  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu">Nicolae Ceausescu</a> got executed, my family decided to immigrate to Germany. We lived for a couple of years in Munchen, my father worked in an Argentinian restaurant. I was going to the kindergarten, although I learned German and I was able to express my self in German, unfortunately, I don't remember much of it. I also lived in Spain for five years, managing a grocery store. I miss Spain.

             <p>    I am a positive person, I like to see the good in people, I am "energetic" I like to laugh and make jokes about anything. I like to speak with different accents, like Franch or Rusian. I like table tennis,  I like music, I am a ScyFy fan. I like to study the universe. I am not a religious person, I am more a spiritual one.
            </p> 
            <p>    I am married to my great wife Mihaela, we have four lovely daughters, Ayane 11 years, Ayaka 7 years, Maya 6 years and last but not least Sara 2 years
